of s

by 
her
 s

on the

of
 hav

nothing

: 
once

she had 
p

book

was 
read

but 
it 
had 
no 
pic

or
 con

it
, “
and 
what 
is the 
use 
of a 
book
,”
 thought 
Alice 
“
without 
pic

s 
or
 con
vers
ation
s
?” 
S
o
 she 
was 
consider
ing 
in
 her 
own
 m

(
as 
well
 as 
she 
c
oul
d, 
for the 
ho
t 
day 
made 
her 
feel
 
very 
s
leep
y and 
st
up

, wh

a 
White 
R
ab

with 
p

eyes 
r
an
 cl

by 
her
. There 
was 
no
th

o 
very 
remark
able 
in
 that
; 
nor
 d

Alice 
th
ink 
it 
so 
very 
much 
out 
of the 
way 
to
 hear
 the 
R
ab

it 
say 
to 
itself
, “
Oh
 d
ear
! 
Oh
 d
ear
! 
I sh
all 
be 
lat

!” 
(
when
 she 
thought 
it 
over
 after
ward
s, 
it 
oc
cur
r
ed to
 her
 that 
she 
ought 
to have 
wonder
ed 
at 
this
, but 
at the 
time 
it 
all
 seem
ed 
quite 
natur

)
; but 
when the 
R
ab
b
it 
ac
tu

too
k
 a w
at
ch 
out 
of 
its 
wa
ist
co

po

, and 
looked 
at 
it, and 
then
 h
ur
ried 
on, 
Alice 
star
ted 
to her 
fe
et, 
for 
it 
fl
ash
ed 
ac
r
os
s 
her 
mind 
that 
she had 
never 
before 
seen
 a 
r
ab
b
it 
with 
eith
er
 a w
a
ist
co
at
-
po
ck
et, 
or
 a w
atch
 to 
take 
out 
of 
it, and 
b
urn
ing 
with
 c
ur
i
os
ity, 
she 
r
an a
cr
os
s the 
fi
eld 
after 
it, and 
fortun
ately 
was 
just 
in 
time 
to see 
it 
po
p
 d
own
 a 
large 
r
ab
bit
-
h
ol
e 
under
 the 
h
ed
ge
. I
n 
another 
moment 
down
 w
ent 
Alice 
after 
it, 
never 
once 
consider
ing h
ow 
in the 
world 
she was 
to 
get 
out 
again
. The 
r
ab
bit
-
h
ol
e 
went 
str
a
ight 
on 
like a 
t
un
n
el 
for
 some 
way
, and 
then 
d
ip
p
ed 
s
udden
ly 
down
, 
so
 s
udden
ly
 that 
Alice 
had 
not 
a m
om
ent 
to
 think
 about 
sto
pp
ing her
self 
before 
she 
found 
her
self 
f
all
ing 
down
 a 
very 
deep
 w
ell
. 
E
ith
er
 the 
well
 was 
very 
deep
, 
or
 she 
fell
 
very 
s
low
ly, 
for
 she had 
pl
ent
y of 
time 
as 
she 
went 
down
 to 
look
 about 
her 
and 
to 
w
ond
er 
what 
was 
go
ing to
 happ
en 
nex
t
. F
ir
st
, she 
tri
ed to 
look
 d
own
 and 
make 
out 
what 
she was 
com
ing to
, but 
it was 
too 
dar
k 
to see 
any
thing
; th
en
 she 
looked 
at 
the s
id
es 
of the 
well
, and 
not
ic
ed that 
they were 
f
ill
ed with
 c
up
board
s and 
book
-
sh
el
ves
;
 h
ere 
and 
there 
she 
saw
 m
ap
s and 
pic
ture
s 
h
ung
 
upon 
p
eg
s
. She 
too
k
 d
own
 a 
j
ar 
from 
one of the 
sh
el
v

as 
she 
pass
ed
; 
it was 
l
ab
ell
ed 
“
O
R
A

A

M
A
L
A
D

”
, but 
to her 
great 
dis
ap
point
ment 
it was 
emp
t
y
:
 she 
did not 
like 
to 
d
rop
 the 
j
ar 
for 
fear
 of 
k
ill
ing s
ome
body 
under
n
eath
, 
so
 man
ag
ed to 
put 
it 
into 
one of the 
c
up
board
s 
as 
she 
fell
 
p
ast 
it
. “
Well
!”
 thought 
Alice 
to
 herself
, “
after
 such
 a 
f
all
 as 
this
, I
 sh
all
 think 
nothing 
of

Wh

I w

any

it, 
even 
if 
I 
fell

(
Wh

 was 
very 
lik

D

down

down

ould 
the 
f
all 
never 
come 
to 
an 
end
? 
“
I w
onder
 how
 many 
mil
es 
I’
ve 
f
all

by
 this

?”
 she 
said 
al
ou
d
. “
I
 must 
be

(
for

you

Alice 
had

of this 
sor

in

on

in the

 this 
was not 
a very 
good 
op
port
un

for
 sh

off
 her 
know

g

there was 
no

it was 
good 
pr

(
Alice 
had 
no 
idea
 
what 
L

was
, 
or 
Long

thought 
they were

P

she 
beg
an

(
she was 
rather

there was 
no

this

as 
it 
did

D
own

down

down
. There 
was 
nothing 
el

to 
do
, 
so 
Alice 
soon 
began 
tal

gain

And 
here 
Alice 
began 
to 
get 
ra

went 
on

did
n’t 
much
 m

she 
put

felt 
that 
she was

had 
just

th

 th

 d

 she 
came 
upon
 a h
ea
p
 of
 st
ick

dr

leav

the 
f
all
 was 
over
. A
li

was not 
a

it 
h
ur

, and 
she 
j
ump
ed 
up 
on 
to her 
feet 
in
 a m
om
ent
:
 she 
looked 
up
, but 
it was 
all
 d
ar
k 
over
head
; 
before 
her 
was 
another 
long 
pass
ag

the 
White 
R
ab
b
it was 
still 
in s

h
ur
ry
ing 
down 
it
. There 
was not 
a m
om

to be 
lo

 a
way 
went 
Alice 
like the 
wind
, and 
was 
just 
in 
time 
to
 hear
 
it 
say
, as 
it 
turn
ed 
a c
orn

, “
Oh
 my 
ear

wh

how 
l

S
he was 
cl

beh

it 
when
 she 
turn

c
orn

but 
the 
R
ab
b
it was 
no 
long
er 
to be 
seen
:
 she 
found 
herself
 in
 a 
long
, 
low
 h
all
, 
which
 was 
li
t 
up 
by 
a 
row
 of 
l
amp
s 
h
ang
ing 
from the 
ro
of
. There 
were 
door
s 
all 
round 
the 
h
all
, but 
they were 
all 
lo
ck
ed
; and 
when 
Alice 
had been 
all the 
way 
down 
one 
sid

up
 the 
other
, 
try
ing 
every 
door
, she 
wal
ked 
s
ad
ly 
down
 the 
m
idd
l

wonder
ing h
ow
 she 
was 
ever 
to 
get 
out 
again
. S
udden
ly 
she 
came 
upon
 a 
little 
th
re

leg
ged 
ta
ble, 
all
 m
ade 
of
 so
li
d 
gl

ere 
was 
nothing 
on 
it 
ex
cep
t 
a 
t
in
y 
g
old
en 
k

, and 
Alice
’s 
first 
thought 
was 
that 
it 
might 
bel
ong
 to 
one of the 
door
s of the 
h
all
; 
bu
t, 
al
as
! 
eith
er
 the 
lo

too 
lar
g
e, 
or
 the 
k

was 
too
 s
m
all
, but 
at 
any 
r
ate 
it 
would 
not 
op
en 
any 
of them
. H
ow
ever
, 
on the 
sec
ond 
time 
r
oun
d, 
she 
came 
upon
 a 
low
 c
ur
tain
 she had 
not 
not
ic
ed 
befor
e, and 
beh
ind 
it was 
a little 
door
 about 
f
if
te
en 
in
ch

high
:
 she 
tri
ed the 
little 
g
old
en 
k

in the 
lo

, and 
to her 
great 
del
ight 
it 
f
it
ted
! 
Alice 
open
ed the 
do
or 
and 
found 
that 
it 
l
ed in
to
 a s
m
all 
pass
age, 
not 
much 
lar
ger
 than
 a 
r
at
-
ho
le
:
 she 
k
n
el
t 
down
 and 
looked 
along
 the 
pass
age 
into the 
lov
el
i
est 
g
ard
en 
you 
ever
 s
aw
. H
ow
 she 
long
ed to 
get 
out 
of that 
d
ark
 h
all
, and 
w
and
er
 about 
among
 those 
be
d
s of 
b
right 
fl
ow
ers 
and 
those 
co
ol
 
f
oun
tain
s, 
but 
she 
could not 
even 
get 
her
 h
ead 
through
 the 
door
way
; “
and 
even 
if
 my 
head 
would 
go
 th
rough
,”
 thought 
poor 
Ali
c
e, “
it 
would be 
of 
very 
little 
use 
without 
my 
sh
oul
der

Oh, 
how 
I w

I
 could 
sh

I
 think 
I
 c

d, 
if 
I 
only 
knew
 how
 to

For
, 
you
 se
e, 
so
 many 
out
-
of
-
the

way
 th
ings 
had 
happ
en
ed 
lat
el

that 
Alice 
had 
beg
un
 to
 think
 that 
very 
few
 th
ings 
inde
ed 
were 
really 
im
possi
ble
. There 
seemed 
to be 
no 
use 
in
 w
a
it
ing 
by the 
little 
door
, 
so
 she 
went 
back 
to the 
ta
ble, 
half
 hop
ing
 she 
might 
find 
another 
k
ey 
on 
it, 
or 
at 
any 
r

a

of

for

up 
like 
t
el
es
c
op

:
 this 
time 
she 
found 
a little 
bot

on 
it, 
(
“
which
 c
er
tain

was not 
here 
befor

,” said 
Alice
,
)
 and 
round 
the 
nec

of the 
bot

was 
a 
p
ap

l
ab

with the 
word

“

beaut
if
ul

pr

on

in

all 
very 
well 
to s

“

but 
the 
w

little 
Alice 
was not 
go

do
 that 
in

No

 she 
said
, “

 she 
very

What

 said 
Alice
; “
I

And 
so 
it was 
inde

 she 
was 
now 
only 
ten

her

b

to see 
if
 she 
was

any

 she 
felt 
a little 
n
erv

about 
this
; “
for 
it 
might 
end
, 
you know
,” said 
Alice 
to
 herself
, “
in

And 
she

bu

al

Alice

when
 she 
got

found 
she had 
for

when
 she 
went 
back

she 
found 
she 
could not

 she 
could 
see 
it 
quite 
plain
ly

rough

she 
t

her 
best 
to 
cl

up 
one of the 
leg

ta

it was 
too
 s

when
 she had 
t

Alice

S

gener

(
though

Wh

S

anx

 cried 
Alice 
(
she was 
so
 much

that 
for the

she 
quite 
for

how

(
for 
when
 she 
looked 
down 
at

they 
seemed 
to be 
almost 
out 
of s

Ali

And 
she

J

then
 her

str

 again
st 
the 
ro

of the

: 
in 
fac

she was 
now
 more

she 
at 
once 
too
k

h
ur

off
 
to the

P

Alice

It 
was 
as 
much
 as 
she 
could 
do
, 
ly

down 
on 
one 
sid

to 
look
 th
rough
 in
to the 
g

 with 
one 
ey

; but 
to 
get 
through
 was 
more 
hop
eless 
than 
ever
:
 she 
s
at 
down
 and 
began 
to 
cr

again
. “
You 
ought 
to be 
as
ham

of 
your

,” said 
Ali
c
e, “
a 
great 
girl
 
like 
you
,” 
(
she 
might 
well
 say
 this
)
, “
to

S
top

I

But 
she 
went 
on 
all the 
s

sh

d
ing 
g
all
on

 there 
was 
a

her
, 
about 
f
our
 in
ch

deep
 and 
reach
ing h
alf

. A
f
ter
 a 
time 
she 
heard 
a little 
p
atter
ing 
of 
feet 
in the 
dist

she 
h
ast
ily 
d
ried 
her 
eyes 
to see 
what 
was 
com

. It was 
the 
White

a

 he 
came 
t

along
 in
 a

Alice 
felt 
so 
des
per

that 
she was 
ready 
to

any 
one

 so
, when

sk
ur

too
k 
up

and
, as 
the 
h

 was

she 
k

all the

she 
went

found 
that
, as

she was 
now
 about 
two

was

 she

 she

to
 herself

(
Alice

once

had 
come

H
ow
ever

soon
 m
ade 
out 
that

po

which
 she had 
w

when

 said 
Ali
c

she 
sw

J

then
 she 
heard 
some
th

in the 
po

 a 
little 
way 
off

she 
sw
am
 
near

out 
what 
it 
was

then
 she 
rem

how

all

she 
soon
 m
ade 
out 
that 
it was 
only 
a m

W

S

 she 
beg
an

I am

of s

O

(
Alice 
thought 
this 
must be 
the 
right 
way 
of s
p

 a m

 she had 
never

The 
M

looked 
at 
her 
rather 
in
qu
is
it
iv

, and 
seem
ed to
 her 
to 
w

 with 
one 
of 
its 
little

it 
said 
no

Alice

which
 was 
the

how

 they 
had 
a

after

it

her
self

would 
only 
say
, “
I am

” 
and 
this 
Alice 
would 
not

, as 
the

pos

ref

there was 
no

 this

just

fell

was 
no

very

in

P

Ali
c

a little 
tim

 she 
was not

S

said 
the

 such
 s

that 
Alice 
quite 
j
ump

she 
saw
 
in 
another 
moment 
that 
it was 
add

to the

not 
to her

so
 she 
too
k
 c
our
ag

went 
on
 again
:
—
 “

Th

; “

I d

Alice 
said 
very 
pol

quite

that

Alice 
did not 
at 
all 
like the 
t

of this 
remark
, and 
thought 
it 
would be 
as 
well
 to

could

 she

to see

No

there 
were 
no

im

they 
went 
on 
for
 some

was 
just 
beg

it was 
ne

more

she 
felt 
that 
it 
would be 
quite 
ab

 her 
to 
car

it 
fur

 she 
se

the

down

felt 
quite

 thought 
Ali

she 
went

Alice

 she

The

K

ea
ger

, and 
he 
h
ur

off

li

thought 
she 
might 
as 
well 
go 
back
, and 
see 
how
 the 
g

was 
going

, as 
she 
heard 
the 
Qu

’s 
vo

in the 
dist

s
cre
am

with 
pass

had 
al
ready 
heard 
her

three 
of the

to be 
ex

for
 hav

mis

their 
turn
s, and 
she 
did not 
like the 
look 
of th

at all
, as 
the 
g

was 
in
 such
 con
f
us
ion
 that 
she 
never 
knew
 
wh
e
ther 
it was 
her 
turn
 
or 
not
. So
 she 
went 
in s
ear
ch
 of
 her
 h
ed
ge
h
og
. The 
h
ed
ge
h

 was 
engag

 a 
f

with 
an
other
 h

ge
h

, 
which
 seem

Alice 
an 
exc
ell
ent 
op
port
un

for
 c
ro
qu
et
ing 
one 
of them
 with the 
other
:
 the 
only 
d
iff
icul
ty 
was
, that 
her 
fl

o
 was 
gone 
ac
r
os
s 
to the 
other
 s

of the 
g

, wh
ere 
Alice 
could 
see 
it 
try
ing 
in
 a h
el
pl

sor
t of 
way 
to 
f

up
 in
to a 
tre

. B
y
 the 
time 
she had 
c
au

the 
fl

o 
and 
brought 
it 
back
, the 
f

was 
over
, and 
both
 the 
h

ge
h
og
s were 
out 
of s

: “
but 
it 
do
es
n’t 
mat
ter 
much
,”
 thought 
Ali
c
e, “
as 
all the 
ar
ch

are 
gone 
from
 this 
side 
of the 
gr

.” 
S
o
 she 
t
uck
ed it 
away 
under
 her 
arm
, that 
it 
might 
not 
es
cap
e 
again
, and 
went 
back 
for a 
little 
more 
con
vers
ation
 with
 her 
friend
. Wh
en
 she 
got 
back 
to the 
Ch
es
h
ire 
C
at
, 
she was 
sur
pris
ed to 
find 
quite 
a 
large 
cr
ow
d 
col
lec
ted 
round 
it
:
 there 
was 
a 
dis
p
ut
e 
going 
on 
between
 the 
ex
ec
ut
ion
er
, the 
K
ing
, and the 
Qu

, who
 were 
all 
tal
king 
at 
on
c
e, 
while 
all the 
res
t 
were 
quite 
sil
ent
, and 
looked 
very 
un
com
for
ta
ble
. The 
moment 
Alice 
appear
ed, 
she was 
app
eal
ed to 
by 
all
 three 
to s
et
tle 
the 
question
, and 
they 
repe
ated 
their 
ar
g
um
ent
s 
to her
, 
though
, as 
they 
all s
po
ke 
at 
on
c
e, 
she 
found 
it 
very 
har
d 
inde
ed to 
make 
out 
exac
tly 
what 
they 
said
. The 
ex
ec
ut
ion
er
’s 
ar
g
um
ent 
was
, that 
you
 c
ould
n’t 
c
ut 
off
 a h
ead 
un
less 
there was 
a 
body 
to 
c
ut 
it 
off
 
from
:
 that 
he had 
never
 had 
to 
do
 such
 a
 th
ing 
befor
e, and 
he 
was
n’t 
go
ing to 
beg
in 
at 
his 
tim
e of 
life
. The 
K
ing
’s 
ar
g
um
ent 
was
, that 
any
thing
 that 
had 
a h

could 
be 
be
head

that 
you w
er
en
’t 
to 
tal
k 
n
on
s
en
se
. The 
Qu

’s 
ar
g
um
ent 
was
, that 
if
 some
thing 
was
n’t 
done 
about 
it 
in 
less 
than 
no 
time 
sh
e
’
d 
have 
every
body 
ex
ec
ut
ed, 
all 
round
. 
(
It 
was 
this 
last 
remark
 that 
had 
made 
the 
whole 
part
y 
look
 so 
gr
ave 
and 
anx

)
 
Alice 
could 
th
ink 
of 
nothing 
el

to s

but 
“
It 
bel

 the 
Qu

 said 
to the 
ex

: “
f

ch
 her

.” 
And 
the 
ex
ec
ut

er 
went 
off
 
like 
an 
ar

. The 
C

’s 
head 
began 
f

 the 
moment 
he was

and, 
by the

he had 
come

 so

S

was

every

her

to 
p

li
ce 
had 
never 
been 
in
 a c

j

ice 
befor

but 
she had 
read 
about 
them 
in 
book
s, and 
she was 
quite 
pleas

find 
that 
she 
knew
 the 
n

of 
near

every
thing
 th
ere
. “
Th
at
’s 
the 
jud

 she 
said 
to
 herself
, “
because 
of his 
great 
w

.” 
The 
jud

by the 
way
, 
was the 
K

; and 
as 
he 
wor
e 
his 
cr

over the 
w

(
look 
at the 
fr

pi

to see 
how
 he 
did 
it
,
)
 he 
did not 
look 
at all
 com
for
ta
bl

it was 
certain
ly 
not 
be
com
ing
. “
And 
that
’s 
the 
j

 thought 
Ali
c
e, “
and 
those 
tw

(
she was 
ob

to s

“

you
 se
e, 
because 
some 
of them
 were 
an

some 
were 
b
ir
d

)
 “
I s
up
pose 
they 
are 
the 
j

S
he 
said 
this 
last 
wor
d 
two 
or
 three 
times 
over 
to
 herself
, 
being 
rather 
pr
ou
d 
of 
it

for
 she 
though
t

righ

too
, that 
very 
few
 
little

 her
 a

knew
 the

of 
it 
at all

ow
ever
, “
j

 would 
have 
done 
just 
as

tw

all
 w

very

What

Alice 
wh

per

to the 
G

Th

St

Alice 
began 
in a

she 
sto

c

out, 
“

and the 
K

put 
on his 
spec

ac

looked 
anx

r
oun
d, 
to make 
out 
who
 was 
tal

li
ce 
could 
se

well
 as 
if
 she 
were 
looking 
over
 their
 sh

der

that 
all the 
j

wr

down
 “
st

on
 their

she 
could 
even
 m

out 
that 
one 
of them
 d
id

that

Alice

On

a

Alice 
could not

she 
went 
round 
the

got 
beh

him

very 
soon 
found 
an 
op

did 
it 
so 
qu

 that 
the 
poor 
little 
j

(
it was 
B

Liz

)
 could 
not 
make 
out 
at 
all 
what 
had 
be

 so
, 
after
 h
un

all
 about 
for 
it, 
he was 
ob

wr

with 
one

this 
was 
of 
very

it

at the

 there

d
rew
 
back 
when the

t

I

 she 
would have 
made 
a 
pre

good

even 
in a

or 
if

was not 
very 
ext
end

she 
knew
 
two
 th
ings 
which 
only 
gen
i
us 
know
s
. The 
one 
was 
hum
an
ity
, and the 
other 
was 
art

On
 the 
first 
head 
she 
could not 
make 
a m

 her 
men, 
though 
l
im

are 
tru

her 
w

in the

A

ar

if
 she 
has 
never 
t

id

her 
re

Mr. Collins

 “

(

, when 
Mr. Darcy 
“

 the

“

 should

in

as 
I have 
put

el

in the

of the

in
ef
f

Mr. Coll
in

Mr. Collins 
is 
really 
great
; 
far 
great
er
 than 
anything 
A
d
dis

ever 
did
, 
almost 
great 
enough
 
for 
F
i
eld

or 
for 
S
wif
t 
himself
. It 
has 
been
 said 
that 
no 
one 
ever 
was 
like 
him
. But 
in the 
first 
plac
e, 
he was 
like 
him
;
 he 
is 
ther
e-
al
iv

im
per

more 
re

 than

In
 the 
sec

plac

it is 
r
ash
, I
 think
, 
to 
con
clud
e 
that 
an

Mr. Collins 
was 
im

or

ex

at the

is 
very

the

the

are 
there
; but 
the 
por
tr
a
it is 
only 
half
 
al

is 
felt 
to be 
even
 a 
little 
un

. 
Mr. Collins 
is 
perfec

perfec

n 
fac

for

 there 
is 
something

er 
if
 many 
of th

the

could not

ex

Jan

next

, 
what 
had 
pass
ed 
betw

Mr.

herself
. 
Jane 
l
isten
ed with
 a
st
on
ish

and 
concern
:
 she 
knew
 
not 
how
 to 
believe 
that 
Mr. Darcy 
could 
be 
so 
un
wor
th
y of 
Mr. Bingle

reg

; and 
yet 
it was 
not 
in
 her 
nat
ure 
to 
question
 the 
ver
ac
ity 
of a 
young
 m
an 
of s
uch
 am
i
able 
appear
ance 
as 
Wickham
. The 
possi
b
il
ity 
of his 
hav

really 
end
ur
ed 
such 
un
kind
ness 
was 
enough
 to 
inter
est 
all
 her 
t
end
er 
feel
ing
s; and 
no
thing
 th
ere
for
e 
remain
ed 
to be 
done 
but 
to
 think
 w
ell
 of
 them 
both
, 
to 
d
ef
end 
the 
con

each
, and 
th
row
 in
to the 
accoun

 ac

or

is
take 
what
ever 
could not 
be 
other
w

ex

Th

have 
both

sh

been

I d
are

V

inde

now
, 
my dear

what

you

 of the

D

 them
, 
too
, 
or
 we 
sh
all 
be 
ob

L
augh
 as 
much
 as 
you 
cho

but 
you w
ill 
not 
laugh
 me 
out 
of

My

Lizz

do 
but 
con

in 
what 
a 
dis

to be

in
 such
 a m

,-
one 
whom
 his 
father
 had 
prom
is

prov

for
. It 
is 
im
possi

. 
No
 m

of 
comm

 h
um

no
 m
an 
who
 had 
any 
val

Oh
 
no
.” “
I can
 much
 more 
eas
ily 
believe 
Mr. Bingle
y’s 
being 
im
pos

on
 than
 that 
Mr. 
Wickham
 should

 a

he 
gave

last 
night
; 
nam

fac

s, 
every

ment

ed 
without

f 
it 
be 
not 
so
, 
let 
Mr. Darcy 
con
tr
ad

es
id

there was

It

On

I 
beg
 
your 
par

;
-

exac

But 
Jane 
could 
think
 with
 c
er
tain
ty 
on 
only 
one 
point
,-
that 
Mr. Bingle
y, 
if he 
had been 
im

on, 
would have 
much 
to s
uff
er 
when the 
af
fa

be
came 
p

two 
young 
lad

were 
s

where 
this

 they

Mr. Bingle

a

 had 
not

any

not

had

pre

remain

it was 
not 
more

 might 
be

in

in the 
Bingle

’
 in

to the

; and 
though
 this 
was not 
exac
tl

 the 
cas

ab

fac

of his 
ab

was 
pr

his

to 
whom
 
Lydi

who 
told 
them
 that 
Wickham
 had 
been 
ob

go 
to

on 
bus
iness 
the

befor

was not

 ad

with
 a s

This 
par

of his 
int

though 
un
heard 
by 
Lydia
, 
was 
c

Elizabeth
; 
and
, as 
it 
ass

 that 
Darc
y 
was not 
less 
answer
able 
for 
Wickham
’s 
ab

than 
if
 her 
first

every 
feel

for
bear

p
at

with 
Darc

was 
in

was 
res

against 
any

, and 
turn

away 
with a

whose

Elizabeth
 was 
not

though 
every

d

for the

it 
could not

 she had 
not

of her

to

him

to her 
particul

two 
first

however, 
brought 
a 
return
 of 
dist

 they 
were 
d

Mr. Coll

without

Mr. Coll

perhaps 
almost

of her 
expec

an 
an

then 
it was 
such

to be

because 
on

no

Mrs. Bennet

No

the

The

no

tre

with the

cont

C

those

how
ever 
open

could

even
 this 
part

gave

at

she had

was 
very

Charlott

ext
ended 
far
ther
 than 
Elizabeth
 had 
any 
con

 of
:
-
its 
objec

was 
nothing 
less 
than 
to s

from 
any 
return

Mr. Coll

by 
engag

Miss

appear

were 
so

that 
when
 they

she

if he 
had 
not 
been

H

here 
she

from

they 
could not

, 
however, 
was 
of the 
most

Miss

as 
per

as 
Mr. Coll

every

On

E

that

U

her

of

but 
his

 was 
not 
quite 
so 
gr

as 
it 
had been 
on his 
first

was 
too

chief

every

was 
sp

by 
him 
at 
Luc

L

he 
sometimes 
return

Longbour

only 
in 
time 
to make 
an a
pol

for
 his 
ab

before 
the

went 
to

Mrs. Bennet 
was 
really 
in
 a m

very

anything 
concern

rew

an a

wh

she 
reg

with

Charlott

, she 
con
clud

to be 
ant

; and 
when
ever
 she 
spo

in a

to 
Mr. Coll
in

was 
con

they were

res
olv

turn

 and 
her

s 
out 
of the

as 
soon
 as 
Mr. Benn

com
plain

bit
ter

of 
all
 this 
to her

. “
In
de

Mr. Benn

sh

it is

This 
was not

therefor
e, 
inst

of 
mak

any

she 
went

I 
never

I am 
not

I

Elizabeth

accoun

Elizabeth

do

my

 d

I am

I should 
be

did not

not 
a 
not

not 
a

did 
I 
rece

in the 
mean

Wh
en
 she 
did 
com

it was 
very 
ev
id
ent 
that 
she had 
no 
pleas
ure 
in 
it
;
 she 
made 
a s
ligh

form
al
 a
pol

for 
not 
call

befor

said 
not 
a w

was
, in 
every

so 
al
ter

a c

when

away 
I was 
perfec

res

no

pit
y, 
though 
I can
not 
help
 
bl
am

her
. She 
was 
very 
wr
ong
 in
 s

l

out

she

I can
 s
af

say
, that 
every 
adv

to 
in

ac
y 
began 
on
 her
 sid

. But 
I 
p
ity 
her
, 
because 
she 
must 
feel
 that 
she 
has 
been
 ac
ting 
wr
ong
, and 
because 
I am 
very 
sure 
that 
anx

y 
for
 her 
bro

is the 
caus

it
. I 
ne

not 
ex
plain
 m
y
self 
far
ther
; and 
though
 we 
know
 this 
anx

y 
to be 
quite 
ne

l

yet 
if
 she 
feel
s 
it, 
it 
will 
eas

accoun

for

be

anx

 can
not

wonder
, 
however, 
at 
her
 hav

any 
such 
fear

now

because 
if he 
had 
at all

we 
must

long
 a

my

I am
 c

from
 some
thing
 she 
said 
herself

yet 
it 
would 
seem
, 
by 
her 
mann

 that

f 
I w

there 
is 
a s

 a

th

of

L

me

from 
you 
very 
soon

Miss Bingle

said 
something 
of his 
never

of 
giv

not

had 
better 
not

 a

ext

gl

that 
you have

P

This 
let
ter 
gave 
Elizabeth
 some 
pain
; but 
her
 sp

its 
return

as 
she 
consider
ed that 
Jane 
would 
no

at le

expec

from the

now
 ab

over

would 
not

any

of his 
att

charac
ter
 s
un

on 
every

 of

and
, as 
a 
p

for
 him
, as 
well
 as 
a 
possible 
adv

age 
to 
Jan

she 
ser

hop
ed 
he 
might 
really 
soon
 m
ar
ry 
Mr. Darc

sister
, 
as
, 
by 
Wickham
’s 
accoun

she 
would 
make 
him
 ab
und
antly 
re
gre
t 
what 
he had 
th
r
own
 a
way
. 
Mrs. 
Gardin
er
 about 
this 
time 
rem
ind
ed 
Elizabeth
 of
 her 
prom
ise 
concern
ing that 
gentle
man
, and 
re
quir
ed in
form
ation
; and 
Elizabeth
 had 
such 
to s
end 
as 
might 
rather 
give 
cont
ent
ment 
to her
 a
un
t 
than 
to
 herself
. His 
ap
par
ent 
part

ity 
had 
sub
sid
ed, 
his 
att

s were 
over
, he 
was the 
ad
mir

of s

one 
el

. Elizabeth
 was 
watch
ful 
enough
 
to see 
it 
all
, but 
she 
could 
see 
it 
and 
wr

of 
it 
without 
mat
er
ial 
pain
. H
er
 hear
t 
had been 
but 
s
ligh

touch

her 
v
an

was 
s
atis
fi

believ
ing that 
she 
would 
have been
 his 
only 
cho

e, 
had 
fortun
e 
perm
it
ted 
it
. The 
s

 ac
qu
is
ition
 of 
ten
 th
ousand 
p

s 
was the 
most 
remark
able 
char

of the 
young 
lad
y 
to 
whom
 he 
was 
now 
r
end

Elizabeth
, 
less 
c

s
igh

perhaps 
in this 
cas

than 
in 
Charlott
e
’
s, 
did not 
quar
rel
 with
 him 
for
 his 
wish
 of 
ind

. 
No
th

on the 
con

could 
be 
more 
natur

; 
and
, wh

able 
me
as

for 
both
, and 
could 
very

wish

ll
 this 
was 
ac
know
led
g

Mrs. 
Gardin
er
; and, 
after 
re
lat
ing the 
c

she 
thus 
went 
on
:
-
“

 should 
at

d

my

are 
not 
only 
cor
di

towards 
him

they 
are 
even 
im

 can
not

that 
I

at all

or
 that 
I am 
in the

 think
 her
 a 
very 
good

can 
be 
no

My

E

in

who

so

that he 
told

almost 
prom

Elizabeth

could 
ob

believ

she

it was

Mr. Collins

looked 
as 
if he 
felt 
that

car

every

Elizabeth

Lady Cather

seemed 
grat

gave 
most

the

the

Mrs.

speak

did 
nothing

 the

there was 
little 
to be 
done 
but 
to

 a

Elizabeth 
found 
that 
nothing

which
 could

was 
a very

as

Lady Cather

 there

 he

In

I can

Darc

some 
con

en
a

to the 
rec

by 
all

could not

without 
rem

his

C

he had 
no

ag

as 
he 
was

did not

her

might 
now
 c

to 
in

this

 was 
soon

answer

down 
for a

then 
get

said 
not

he 
came

thus 
beg
an

-
 “

there 
were

could not

from the

what 
had

it was 
im

f
, 
in the

I am

 can

necess

must be 
o
be

fur
ther
 a
pol

would be 
ab

 had 
not

before 
I s

your

it was 
not 
till
 the 
even

of the 
d

at 
N

fi

that 
I had 
any

at
ta

 had 
often

that 
b
all
, wh

I had 
the 
hon

 of 
d

with

, I
 was 
first 
made 
ac

by 
S

W

Luc
as
’s 
acc

 had 
giv

to a

spo

al

I 
observ

then 
per

Benn

was 
be

what 
I had 
ever 
w
it

. Y
our

I 
also
 w

look 
and

were 
op

ch

ful
, and 
engag

 as 
ever
, but 
without 
any 
s

m
p

 of 
peculi

reg

; and 
I 
remain
ed 
con
v
inc

from the 
even
ing
’s 
s
cr

in
y, 
that 
though
 she 
receiv

att

with 
pleas

, she 
did not 
inv

them 
by 
any 
part

you have 
not

I

in 
an

our
 sup

must 
make 
the 
lat

prob

so

if 
I have 
been

such

p

on
 her
, 
your 
res

has 
not 
been

I sh
all 
not 
s

to
 as
ser

that 
the s

en

your

coun

such

might 
have

ob

 a

 that
, 
however
 am
i
able 
her 
t
em
per
, 
her
 hear
t 
was not 
lik

to be 
eas
ily 
touch
ed
. Th
at 
I was 
des
ir

of 
believ

ind

is 
certain
; but 
I w
ill 
v

to s

 that 
my 
inv

dec

ion
s are 
not 
us
u
ally 
in
flu
enc

my 
hop

or 
fear
s
. I
 d
id 
not 
believe 
her 
to be 
ind

ent 
because 
I w
ished 
it
; 
I 
believ

on 
im
part
ial
 con

, as 
tru

as 
I w

it 
in

. 
My 
objec

to the 
marri

were 
not 
mer

 those 
which 
I 
last

ac

re

ut
most 
for

of

 to 
put 
as

in
 my 
own
 c

; the 
w

of 
con
nec

 could 
not be 
so 
great 
an 
evil
 to 
my 
fri
end 
as 
to 
me
. But 
there 
were 
other 
caus

rep

; 
caus

which
, 
though

I had 
my

Mr.

the s

of a 
very

 had 
for
 many

on 
G

Wickham

 was 
his

his

was 
therefor
e 
li

My

 sup

at

after

at 
C

most 
import

ass

as 
his 
own 
father
, 
always 
poor 
from the 
ex

of his 
wif

would have 
been 
un
able 
to 
give 
him
 a 
gentle

’s

My 
fa

was not 
only 
f

of this 
young
 man
’s 
so
c

whose 
mann

were 
always

he had 
also
 the

be

for
 m

self
, 
it is 
man

many 
year
s 
s

I 
first 
began 
to
 think 
of
 him
 in
 a 
very 
differ

mann

. The 
vic

pro

the

of 
pr

which he 
was 
car

ful
 to 
gu

from the 
know

of his 
best 
friend
, 
could not 
es
cap

observ

 of
 a 
young
 m

of 
near

 the 
same 
age 
with
 himself
, and 
who
 had 
op

of s

 him 
in 
un

mom

which 
Mr. Darcy 
could not

ere 
again 
I sh
all 
give 
you 
pain
-
to 
what 
de

you 
only 
can 
tell
. But 
what
ever 
may be 
the s

which 
Mr.

 has 
cre
at

a s

sh
all 
not

My

fa

di

about 
f

year
s 
ag

; and 
his 
at
ta
ch

to 
Mr.

 was 
to the 
last 
so
 st

that 
in his

 he 
particular

comm

to

to

his

in the

 that 
his

if he 
too

des

a

family 
liv

might 
be 
his 
as 
soon
 as 
it

came 
v

was 
also
 a 
leg

one 
th

p

own 
fa

did not 
long
 s

with
in

alf
 a 
year
 
from

Mr.

 w

to

that
, 
hav

against

he

I should 
not

able 
for
 him
 to 
expec

some 
more 
immedi

pec
un
i

adv

in 
li

u
 of the 
pre
fer
ment
, 
by 
which he 
could not 
be 
ben

it

. He 
had 
some 
int

, he 
add
ed, 
of
 st
ud
y
ing the 
l

, and 
I
 must 
be 
aw
are 
that the 
inter

of 
one 
th
ousand 
p

s 
would be 
a very 
in
su
ff
ic
ient 
sup
por

there
in
. I 
rather 
wish
ed 
than 
believ
ed 
him 
to be 
s
in
cer

bu
t, 
at 
any 
r
at

was 
perfec

ready 
to
 ac
c

e 
to his 
pro

. I 
knew
 that 
Mr. 
Wick
ha
m 
ought 
not 
to be 
a c
l

g

man
. The 
bus
iness 
was 
therefor
e 
soon
 s
et
t
led
. He 
res
ign

all
 cl
a
im
 to
 as
s
ist
ance 
in the 
ch

ch
, 
were 
it 
possible 
that he 
could 
ever 
be 
in
 a s
it
u

 to 
rece

it, and 
ac
cep
ted 
in 
return
 three 
th
ousand 
p

s
. A
ll
 con
nec

betw
een 
us 
seemed 
now
 dis
sol

. I
 thought 
too 
ill 
of
 him
 to 
inv

him
 to 
P
ember
le

or
 ad
m
it 
his 
so
c

in

n 
tow

, 
I 
believ
e, 
he 
chief
ly 
liv

but 
his 
st

y
ing the

 was 
a m
ere 
pre
ten

; and 
being 
now 
f
ree 
from 
all 
re
str

his 
life 
was 
a 
lif

id
l
eness 
and 
dis
s
ip

. For
 about 
three 
year
s 
I
 hear
d 
little 
of
 him
; but 
on the 
dec

e 
of the 
inc

b

of the 
liv

which
 had 
been 
des
ign

for
 him
, he 
app
li
ed to 
me 
again 
by 
let

for the 
present
ation
. His 
c
ircumst
anc

he 
ass

I had 
no
 d
iff
icul

in 
believ
ing 
it, 
were 
ex

ingly 
b

. He 
had 
found 
the 
l

 a m

un
prof

able 
st

was 
now
 ab
sol
ut

res
olv

on 
being 
ord
ain

if 
I
 would 
present 
him 
to the 
liv
ing 
in 
question
-
of 
which he 
tr
ust
ed 
there 
could 
be 
little 
doub

as 
he was 
well
 as
sur

I had 
no 
other 
pers

to 
prov

for
, and 
I
 could 
not 
have 
for
go

father
’s

You
 w

bl

me 
for 
ref

comp

with
 this 
ent
re
at

or 
for 
res
ist

every 
rep

 of 
it

res

was 
in 
pro
por

to the 
dist

of his 
c

and 
he was

in his 
ab

to 
other

as 
in his

. A

every

of

. Elizabeth
, when 
Mr. Darcy

did not 
expec

form

such
 as 
they

it 
may be

how

went 
through

what 
a

 they 
exc

. H
er 
feel

as 
she 
read 
were 
sc
arc

de

she 
first 
under

beg
an
 his 
accoun

what 
had

at 
N

read 
with 
an

 h

left

was

his 
accoun

made 
her 
too

express

 his

when

bor

so 
al
arm
ing

 af

to his 
own
 his
tor

-
her 
feel

were

more 
ac

 and

-
and 
when
 she had 
gone 
through

whole 
let

though

it

 in

re

and
ed her
self
 so 
far
 as 
to 
ex
am

the 
mean

of 
every 
s

. The 
accoun

of his 
con

 with the 
P

le

family 
was 
exac

what 
he had 
rel

himself
; and the 
kind

of the

Mr. Darc

though
 she had 
not

know

al
 con

m
ed the 
other
; but 
when
 she 
came 
to the 
will
, the 
differ

was 
great
. 
What 
Wickham
 had 
said 
of the 
liv
ing 
was 
fre
sh
 in
 her 
m
em
or
y
; and 
as 
she 
rec
all
ed his 
very 
word
s, 
it was 
im
possible 
not 
to 
feel
 that 
there was 
gr
os
s 
d
up
lic

on 
one 
side 
or
 the 
other
, 
and, 
for a 
few
 m
om
ent
s, 
she 
fl
atter
ed her
self
 that 
her 
wish
es 
did not 
er

. But 
when
 she 
read 
and 
re
-
read
, 
with the 
cl
os
est 
att

, the 
particular
s 
immedi
ately 
follow

of 
Wickham
’s 
res

all

of his

in

a s

three 
th

p

again
 was 
she 
for
c

at
e
. She 
put 
down
 the 
let

we
igh

with 
what

on the 
prob

each
 st

-
but 
with 
little 
s

. 
O
n 
both
 sid

it was 
only 
ass

. A

 she 
read 
on
. But 
every

Mr. Darc

in 
it 
less

was 
cap

of a

which
 must 
make

more 
so
, as 
she 
could

never

no

H

in

been 
in

she had 
never

es

at

the

at

that 
after

which
 her

H

In

repli

Elizabeth
, “
I am

But

What 
a

was 
this 
for 
poor 
Jan

who
 would 
will

have 
gone

so

ex

N

 was 
Darc

cap
able 
of 
con

for
 such
 dis

did 
she 
l

see
k 
to 
c

one, 
without 
inv

other
. “
This 
will 
not 
do
,” said 
Elizabeth
; “
you 
never 
will be 
able 
to make 
both

you
 must

is

such
 a 
qu

just 
enough
 to 
make 
one

of

been

It 
was 
some

however, 
before 
a s

be

Jan

sh

Elizabeth

at

On

Elizabeth

E
very

good

she 
looked

from

This

from
 such

had been

she had

H

E
very 
idea
 that 
had been 
brought

was 
favour

on

Per

Wh

Mrs.

not

could 
go

only 
of

their

they were 
again
 s

Elizabeth
’s 
ast
on

was 
quite 
equ

to 
what 
it 
had been 
at 
fir
st
, 
by the 
s

of 
Mr. Darcy 
ap
pro
ach

, and 
at 
no 
great 
dist

. The 
wal

be

on the

allow

them 
to see 
him 
before 
they

, 
however
 a
st

was 
at le

more 
pre

for 
an 
inter

res

 and 
to sp

if he 
really

 a 
few
 m

inde

she 
felt 
that he 
would 
prob

him 
from
 their

; the 
turn

p

he was 
immedi

before 
them
. W
ith
 a 
gl
ance 
she 
saw
 that 
he had 
l

n
one 
of his 
rec

civil

; and, 
to 
im

ate 
his 
pol

she 
beg
an
 as 
they 
m

to
 ad

of the

she had 
not 
got 
be

the 
word
s 
“
del

and 
“
ch

when
 some 
un

she 
fanc

col

she 
said 
no

Mrs. 
Gardin
er 
was 
stand

little 
beh

; and 
on
 her 
p

he 
as
ked 
her 
if
 she 
would 
do
 him
 the 
hon
our
 of 
int
ro
duc
ing him
 to
 her 
friend
s
. This 
was 
a
 st
ro
ke 
of 
civil

for 
which
 she 
was 
quite 
un
pre
par

; and 
she 
could 
h
ardly 
sup
pres

a s
m

at 
his 
being 
now
 s

ing the 
ac

of s

of th

very

against 
whom
 his 
p

had 
rev

in his 
off

to
 herself
. “
What 
will be 
his

 thought 
sh

He 
tak

them

for

The 
int

, 
however, 
was 
immedi

mad

as 
she 
nam

their

sto

a s

was not

and, 
so

from

turn

back

enter

Mr.

 could 
not

be 
pleas

could not

con

he 
should

some 
rel

whom
 there 
was 
no

upon

she 
heard 
Mr. Darcy 
inv

him

with the

as

Mrs.

, who
 was 
wal

ar

in

Elizabeth

gave 
her
 a

 said 
no

it 
grat

ex

without

it was

it was 
grat

know
 that 
his

not

him
 think 
really

not

 that 
was 
im

she was 
fl

pleas

 of 
int

to her 
was 
a
 com

of the

Mr.

they

such

repli

I was

more

it was 
really

there was 
no

Elizabeth 
exc

self
 as

 said 
that 
she had

that 
she had 
never

perhaps

repli

Elizabeth

that 
they

said 
no

 con

Mrs.

On

there 
is 
something

that 
by 
what 
she had

his

cap

of a 
very 
differ

that

Mrs.

but 
as 
they were 
now
 a

every

were

of the 
prec

open

 a

No

 had 
ever

befor

but 
they 
now 
felt 
that 
there was

from
 such

Wh

per

Elizabeth

was 
every

she

l

the 
part

of the 
bro

 should 
have 
said 
too
 much
 in
 her 
favour
; and, 
more 
than
 com

only 
anx

to 
pleas

she 
natur
ally 
s
us
pec

that 
every 
pow

pleas

would 
f

 her
. She 
re
tre

from the

fear
ful
 of 
be

 se

; and 
as 
she 
wal

up

end

W

 a

did 
Elizabeth
 see 
that 
her 
new

quain

was 
at le

as 
much

as 
herself
. S
ince 
her 
being 
at 
L

she had 
heard 
that 
Miss 
Darc

was 
ex

the 
observ

 of
 a 
very 
few
 m

con

inc

 that 
she was 
only 
ex

Miss

was

Elizabeth

though 
little

was

there was 
s

good

her

were 
perfec

had 
not 
been

Darc

told 
her
 that 
Bingle

was 
also
 com

she had 
bar

pre

was 
pleas

on
 this 
accoun

as

cap

of

E

then

she had 
no

Mr.

; 
it was 
not 
their

ev

that 
she was 
much 
better
 ac

with 
Mr. Darc

 than
 they 
had 
before 
any 
idea
 of

it was 
ev
id

that 
he was 
very 
much 
in

 her

saw
 much
 to

but 
nothing

O

Mr. Darcy 
it was 
now
 a m

to

and
, as 
far
 as 
their

there was 
no

could not 
be 
unt

his

had 
they 
draw

had 
nothing

but 
p

p

he 
prob

it

however

much

that

not

for

Mr. Darcy

was not 
long

 to

No

G

, 
though 
pro

with

al

con

 was 
car

Miss

looked 
as

wish

sometimes

when
 there 
was

d

 soon
 s

that

speak

Miss

without

not

had 
they 
not 
been
 se

she was 
not

necess

of s

much
:
 her 
own
 though

were 
em

expec

every 
moment 
that 
some 
of the 
gentle

 would 
enter

:
 she 
wish

she 
fear
ed, 
that the 
mas

of the 
hous

might 
be 
among
st 
them
; and 
wh
ether
 she 
wish

or 
fear

most
, she 
could 
sc

by the

then,

but 
a m

before 
she had 
believ

she 
began

No

not

one

Jan

she

fl

ur
pr

was the 
le

all

the 
cont

she was 
all s

now 
it was 
all 
too

 such 
an a

th
is, 
she 
might 
have 
su

though

did not 
sup

Lydi

del

engag

in 
an

without 
the

she had 
no

ne

pres

never

any

she was 
con

inc

 had 
w
an

only 
enc

to
 a

had been

their

never

the 
most

then
 he

nothing

any

it was 
certain

no

s

he had 
been

did not

he was

who
 could 
be 
poin

in the

there was 
a very

 to

his

still

Mr.

This

Mr.

on the 
most 
hon

able 
ter

it was 
not 
to be 
sup
pos

Mr. Darcy 
would 
con
nec

himself
 with
 a 
famil

where 
to 
every 
other 
objec

 would 
now 
be 
add

an

and 
rel

ship
 of the 
near
est 
kind 
with the 
man 
whom
 he 
so 
j

. F
r
om
 such
 a
 con

 she 
could not 
wonder
 that 
he 
should 
sh

. The 
wish
 of 
pro
cur

reg
ard
, 
which
 she had 
ass
ur
ed her
self
 of his 
feel
ing 
in 
D

by
sh

, 
could not 
in 
r
ation
al 
expec

ation
 s
ur
v
ive 
such
 a 
bl

 as 
this
. She 
was 
hum
ble

she was 
g
ri
ev

;
 she 
rep
ent
ed, 
though
 she 
h
ardly 
knew
 of 
what
. She 
be
came 
j

of his 
est

 she 
could 
no 
long
er
 hop

to be 
ben

it
. She 
w
an

to
 hear
 of
 him
, when
 there 
seem
ed the 
le
ast 
ch
ance 
of 
gain

int
el
li

. She 
was 
con
v
inc

she 
could 
have been
 happ

with
 him
, when 
it was 
no 
long
er 
lik

should

What 
a 
tri

 for
 him
, as 
she 
often
 though

could 
he 
know
 that 
the

which
 she had 
pr

only

now
 have 
been 
gl

He 
was 
as 
gener

she 
doub

no

as the 
most 
gener

of his

while 
he was 
mor
tal
, 
there 
must be 
a 
tri

ph
. She 
began 
now
 to 
com
preh

that 
he was 
exac

 the 
man 
who
, in 
dis
pos

 and 
tal

would 
most 
su

. His 
under
stand

t
em
per
, 
though 
un
like 
her 
own
, 
would have 
answer
ed 
all
 her 
wish

. It was 
an 
un

 that 
must 
have been 
to the 
adv

ag

both
: 
by 
her 
eas

liv

in

his 
mind 
might 
have been
 s
often

his 
mann

im
prov

; and 
from his 
jud
g
ment
, in
form

, and 
know
led

of the 
worl

she 
must 
have 
receiv
ed 
ben
ef
it 
of 
great

import

. But 
no

ad

m

how

No

H

Th

Mr.

 had 
receiv

before 
he 
left 
L

he was 
to

of a

one 
but 
Mrs. Bennet 
re
gre

that 
their
 st

would be 
so
 shor

she 
made 
the 
most

with
 her

, and 
hav

very 
fre

to
 a

was 
even
 more 
des

to s

did 
think

 such

Wickham
’s 
af

for 
Lydia
 was 
just 
what 
Elizabeth
 had 
expec

to 
find 
it
; 
not 
equ

. She 
had 
sc

ne

to be 
s

from the 
reason 
of th

that 
their

had been 
brought 
on 
by the 
str

 of
 her 
love 
ra

by 
his

she 
would have 
wonder

wh

without

ch

to

she 
not

necess

by 
dist

c

anc

; and 
if
 that 
were 
the 
cas

he was 
not 
the 
young
 m

to

is
t 
an 
op

of
 hav

 com

Lydia
 was 
ex

ingly 
f

of
 him
. He 
was 
her 
dear
 
Wick
ha

on 
every 
occasion
; 
no 
one 
was 
to be 
put 
in
 com
p
et

 with
 him
. He 
did 
every
thing 
best 
in the 
world
; and 
she was 
sure 
he 
would 
k
ill
 more 
b

on the 
first

S
ep
t

any

On

soon
 after
 their 
ar
riv

, as 
she was 
s
it

with
 her 
two

she 
said 
to 
Elizabeth
,- “

You

No

repli

Elizabeth

L

You

But 
I

St

Wickham

My

I w

Well

M
on

morn

c

I was 
in
 such

I was 
so
 a

you know

something 
would 
happ

put

then 
I should

there was

all the

I was

Well
, and 
so
 we 
break
f
as

at 
ten
 as 
us

I
 thought 
it 
would 
never 
be 
over

for
, 
by the 
by

you are 
to 
under

that 
my 
un

a

were 
hor

I was

f 
you

believe 
me, 
I d

not 
once 
put

I was

Not

Well

so
, 
just 
as the

came 
to the

my 
un

was 
called

upon

then, 
you know

once 
they 
get

there 
is 
no

I d

not

to

for
 my 
un

was 
to

away

if

Mr. Darc

repe

Elizabeth
, in 
utter
 a
ma

. “
Oh,

What

It

Jan

On

Elizabeth
 was 
for
c

to

im

Mr. Darcy 
had been

My

N

ec

I have 
just 
receiv
ed 
your 
letter
, and 
sh
all
 d
ev
ot
e 
this 
whole 
morn
ing to 
answer
ing 
it
, as 
I 
for
es
ee 
that 
a little 
wr
it
ing 
will 
not 
com
pr
ise 
what 
I have 
to 
tell 
you
. I
 must 
conf
ess 
myself
 s
ur
pris
ed by 
your
 a
pp
lic
ation
; 
I d
id 
not 
expec
t 
it 
from 
you
. 
D
on’t 
think
 me 
an
gr
y, 
however, 
for 
I 
only 
me
an 
to 
let 
you know
, that 
I had 
not 
im
ag
in
ed 
such
 in
quir
ies 
to be 
necess
ary 
on 
your
 sid

. I
f 
you d
o not 
cho

to 
under
stand 
me, 
for
give 
my 
im
per
t
in
ence
. Y
our 
un
cl
e 
is 
as 
much
 s
ur
pris
ed 
as 
I am
; and 
nothing 
but 
the 
beli
ef
 of 
your 
be
ing a 
part
y 
concern
ed 
would have 
allow
ed him
 to
 ac
t 
as 
he 
has 
d
one
. But 
if 
you are 
really 
in
no
c
ent 
and 
ign
or
an
t, 
I
 must 
be 
more 
ex
p
lic
it
. 
On
 the 
very 
day 
of 
my 
com
ing h
ome 
from 
Longbour
n
, 
your 
un
cl
e 
had 
a m
ost 
un
expec

vis
i
tor
. 
Mr. Darcy 
call
ed, and 
was 
sh
ut 
up
 with
 him
 s
ever
al
 h
our
s
. It was 
all 
over 
before 
I 
ar
riv

;
 so
 my 
cur
i
os
ity 
was not 
so 
d
read
fully 
r
ack
ed 
as 
your
s 
seem
s 
to have 
been
. He 
came 
to 
tell 
Mr. 
Gardin
er
 that 
he had 
found 
out 
where 
your
 s
ister 
and 
Mr. 
Wickham
 w
er
e, and 
that 
he had 
se
en 
and 
tal
ked 
with
 them 
both
-
Wick
ha
m 
repe
at
ed
ly, 
Lydi
a 
on
ce
. F
r
om
 
what 
I can
 c
ol
lec
t, 
he 
left 
D
er
by
sh
ire 
only 
one 
day 
after 
our
selv
es, and 
came 
to 
tow
n
 with the 
res
ol
ut
ion
 of
 h
un
ting 
for
 them
. The 
mo
t
ive 
prof
ess
ed 
was 
his 
con
vic
tion
 of 
its 
being 
ow
ing to
 himself
 that 
Wickham
’s 
wor
th
less
ness 
had 
not 
been
 so
 w
ell
 
known
 as 
to make 
it 
im
possible 
for 
any 
young
 w
om
an 
of 
charac
ter 
to 
love 
or
 con
f
ide 
in
 him
. He 
gener
ously 
imp
u
ted 
the 
whole 
to his 
mis
taken 
p
rid
e, and 
conf
ess
ed that 
he had 
before 
thought 
it 
ben
eath
 him
 to 
l
ay 
his 
p
riv
ate 
ac
tions 
op
en 
to the 
world
. His 
charac
ter 
was 
to sp
eak 
for 
itself
. He 
called 
it, 
therefor
e, 
his 
d
ut
y 
to s
t
ep
 for
ward
, and 
end
eav
our
 to 
rem
ed
y 
an 
evil
 
which
 had 
been 
brought 
on 
by 
himself
. I
f
 he 
had 
another 
mo
t
iv
e, 
I am
 s
ure 
it 
would 
never 
dis
gr
ac
e 
him
. He 
had been
 some 
day
s in 
tow
n 
before 
he was 
able 
to 
dis
c
over
 them
; but 
he had 
something 
to 
direc
t 
his 
s
ear
ch
, 
which
 was 
more 
than
 we 
had
; and the 
con
sc
ious
ness 
of this 
was 
another 
reason 
for
 his 
res
olv
ing to 
f
oll
ow 
us
. There 
is a 
lad
y, 
it 
seem
s, 
a 
Mrs. 
Y
oun
g
e, 
who
 was 
some 
time 
ag
o 
go
ver
ness 
to 
Miss 
Darc
y, and 
was 
dis
mis
s
ed 
from
 her 
char
ge 
on
 some 
caus
e of 
dis
ap
prob
ation, 
though
 he 
did not 
say 
what
. She 
then 
too
k
 a 
large 
hous
e 
in 
E
d
ward 
St
re
et
, and 
has 
s
ince 
m
ain
tain
ed her
self 
by 
le
tt
ing 
lo
d
g
ings
. This 
Mrs. 
Y
oun
ge 
was
, he 
knew
, in
tim
ately 
ac
quain
ted 
with 
Wickham
; and 
he 
went 
to her 
for 
int
el
lig
ence 
of
 him
, as 
soon
 as 
he 
got 
to 
tow
n
. But 
it was 
two 
or
 three 
day
s 
before 
he 
could 
get 
from
 her 
what 
he 
w
ant
ed
. She 
would 
not 
be
tr
ay 
her 
tr
ust
, I
 sup
pos
e, 
without 
b
ri
ber
y and 
cor
r
up
tion
, 
for
 she 
really 
did 
know 
where 
her 
fri
end 
was 
to be 
f
ound
. 
Wickham
, 
inde
ed, 
had 
gone 
to her 
on
 their 
first 
ar
riv
al 
in 
L
ond
on
; and 
had 
she 
been
 a
ble 
to 
rece
ive 
them
 in
to her
 h
ous
e, 
they 
would have 
taken 
up
 their
 a
bod
e 
with
 her
. At 
length
, 
however, 
our 
kind 
fri
end 
pro
cur
ed the 
wish
ed
-
for
 d
i
rec
tion
. They 
were 
in 
-
-
 
St
re
et
. He 
saw
 
Wickham
, and 
after
wards 
ins
is
ted 
on
 s
ee
ing 
Lydia
. His 
first 
objec
t 
with
 her
, he 
ac
know
led
g
ed, 
had been 
to 
per
su
ade 
her 
to 
qu
it 
her 
present 
dis
gr
ac
e
ful
 s
it
u
ation
, and 
return
 to
 her 
friend
s 
as 
soon
 as 
they 
could 
be 
prev
ail
ed 
on 
to 
rece
ive 
her
, 
off
er
ing his 
ass
ist
ance 
as 
far
 as 
it 
would 
go
. But 
he 
found 
Lydia
 ab
sol
ut
ely 
res
olv
ed 
on 
remain
ing 
where 
she 
was
. She 
car
ed 
for 
n
one 
of her 
friend
s;
 she 
w
an
ted 
no
 h
el
p
 of
 his
;
 she 
would 
not 
hear
 of 
leav
ing 
Wickham
. She 
was 
sure 
they 
should 
be 
mar
ried 
some 
time 
or 
other
, and 
it 
did not 
much
 s
ign
if
y 
when
. S
ince 
such
 were 
her 
feel
ings, 
it 
only 
remain
ed, 
he 
though
t, 
to s
ec
ure 
and 
ex
p
ed
ite 
a m
ar
ri
age, 
which
, 
in his 
very 
first 
con
vers
ation
 with 
Wickham
, he 
eas
ily 
lear
n
t 
had 
never 
been
 his 
des
ign
. He 
conf
ess
ed him
self 
ob
lig
ed to 
leave 
the 
reg
im
ent 
on
 ac
coun
t 
of s
ome 
de
b
ts 
of
 h
on
our 
which
 were 
very 
press

; and 
s
cr
up
led 
not 
to

all the 
ill
 con
sequ
enc
es of 
Lydia
’s 
f
light 
on
 her 
own 
f
ol

al
one
. He 
me
ant 
to 
res
ign
 his 
comm
is
s
ion 
immedi
at

; and 
as 
to his 
f
ut
ure 
s
it
u
ation
, he 
could 
con
jec
t
ure 
very 
little 
about 
it
. He 
must 
go
 some
wh
ere, 
but 
he 
did not 
know 
wh
er
e, and 
he 
knew
 he 
should 
have 
nothing 
to 
live 
on
. 
Mr. Darcy 
as
ked 
wh
y 
he 
did not 
mar
ry 
your
 s
ister 
at 
on
ce
. Th
ough
 
Mr. Benn
et 
was not 
im
ag
in
ed 
to be 
very 
ri
ch
, he 
would 
have been
 a
ble 
to 
do
 some
thing 
for
 him
, and 
his 
s
it
u
ation
 must 
have been 
ben
ef
it
ed by 
marri
age
. But 
he 
f
oun
d, 
in 
rep
ly 
to
 this 
question
, that 
Wickham
 st
ill 
ch
er
ish
ed the 
hop
e of 
more 
ef
fec
tu
ally 
mak
ing his 
fortun
e 
by 
marri
age, 
in
 some 
other 
coun
try
. 
U
n
der
 such
 c
ircumst
anc
es, 
however
, he 
was not 
lik
ely 
to be 
pro
of
 again
st 
the 
t
emp
t
ation
 of 
immedi
ate 
re
li
ef
. They 
m
et 
se
ver
al 
tim

for
 there 
was 
much 
to be 
dis
c
us
s
ed
. 
Wickham
, 
of 
cour
s
e, 
w
an
ted 
more 
than
 he 
could 
get
; but 
at 
length
 was 
re
duc
ed 
to be 
reason
able
. 
E
ver
y
thing 
be
ing s
et
tl
ed 
between
 them
, 
Mr. Darc
y’s 
next 
st
ep
 was 
to make 
your 
un
cl

ac
quain
ted 
with 
it, and 
he 
first 
call
ed in 
G
r
ac
e
ch
ur
ch 
St

et 
the 
even
ing 
before 
I
 c
ame 
h

. But 
Mr. 
Gardin
er 
could not 
be 
seen
; and 
Mr. Darcy 
f
oun
d, 
on 
fur
ther 
in
quir
y, 
that 
your 
fa
ther 
was 
still
 with
 him
, but 
would 
qu
it 
tow
n
 the 
next 
morn
ing
. He 
did not 
jud
ge 
your 
fa
ther 
to be 
a 
pers
on 
whom
 he 
could 
so 
pro
per
ly 
con
s

t 
as 
your 
un

e, and 
therefor
e 
read
ily 
po
st
p
on
ed 
see
ing
 him 
till
 after
 the 
de
part
ure 
of the 
form
er
. He 
did not 
leave 
his 
nam
e, and 
till
 the 
next 
day 
it was 
only 
known
 that 
a 
gentle
man
 had 
called 
on 
bus
in
ess
. 
O
n 
S
at
ur
day 
he 
came 
again
. Y
our 
fa
ther 
was 
g
one, 
your 
un
cl
e 
at 
h
om
e, 
and
, as 
I
 said 
befor
e, 
they 
had 
a 
great 
de
al 
of 
tal
k 
to
gether
. They 
m
et 
again 
on 
S
un
day
, and 
then 
I s
aw
 him 
too
. It was 
not 
all s
et
tl
ed 
before 
M
on
day
:
 as 
soon
 as 
it 
was
, the 
ex
pres
s 
was 
s
ent 
off
 to 
Longbour
n
. But 
our 
vis
i
tor
 was 
very 
ob
st
in
at
e
. I 
fanc
y, 
Lizz
y, 
that 
ob
st
in
ac
y 
is the 
re
al
 d
ef
ec
t 
of his 
charac
ter, 
after 
all
. He 
has 
been
 ac
c
us
ed 
of 
many 
fa
ul
ts 
at 
differ
ent 
tim
es
; but 
this 
is the 
tru
e 
one
. 
No
thing 
was 
to be 
done 
that he 
did not 
do
 himself
; th
ough
 
I am
 s
ure 
(
and 
I d
o not 
sp
eak 
it 
to be 
than
k
ed, 
therefor
e 
say 
no
th
ing about 
it
)
 
your 
un
cl
e 
would 
most 
read
ily 
have 
se
t
tl
ed the 
who
le
. They 
b
at
tl
ed it 
to
ge
ther 
for a 
long 
time, 
which
 was 
more 
than 
eith
er
 the 
gentle
man 
or 
lad
y 
concern
ed in 
it 
des
erv
ed
. But 
at last 
your 
un
cl
e 
was 
for
c
ed to 
y
i
eld
, and 
inst
ead 
of 
being 
allow
ed 
to be 
of 
use 
to his 
n
i
ec
e, 
was 
for
c
ed to 
put 
up
 with 
only 
hav
ing the 
prob
able 
cre
d
it 
of 
it, 
which
 w
ent 
sor
ely 
against 
the 
gr
ain
; and 
I 
really 
believe 
your 
letter
 this 
morn
ing 
gave 
him 
great 
pleas
ure
, 
because 
it 
re
quir
ed 
an 
ex
plan
ation
 that 
would 
ro
b
 him
 of his 
bor
row
ed 
f
ea
ther
s, and 
give 
the 
pr
a
ise 
where 
it was 
d
u
e
. B
ut, 
Lizz
y, 
this 
must 
go 
no 
fur
ther
 than 
your
self
, 
or 
Jane 
at 
most
. You
 
know 
pre
tt
y 
well
, I
 sup
pos
e, 
what 
has 
been 
done 
for the 
young 
pe
op
le
. His 
de
b
ts 
are 
to be 
p
aid
, 
am
oun
t
ing, 
I 
believ
e, 
to 
consider
ably 
more 
than
 a
 th
ousand 
p
ound
s, 
an
other
 th
ousand 
in
 ad
d
ition
 to
 her 
own
 s
et
tl
ed 
upon
 her
, and 
his 
comm
is
s
ion 
pur
chas
ed
. The 
reason 
wh
y 
all
 this 
was 
to be 
done 
by 
him 
al
one, 
was 
such
 as 
I have 
giv
en
 a
bo
v
e
. It was 
ow
ing to
 him, 
to his 
res
er
ve 
and 
w
ant 
of 
pro
per 
consider
ation
, that 
Wickham
’s 
charac
ter
 had 
been
 so
 m
is
under
s
too
d
, and 
con
sequ
ent
ly
 that 
he had 
been 
receiv
ed and 
not
ic
ed 
as 
he 
was
. 
Per
hap
s 
there was 
some 
tru
th
 in
 this
; th
ough
 
I d
oub
t 
wh
ether
 his 
res
erv
e, 
or 
any
bod
y’s 
res
er
ve 
can 
be 
answer
able 
for the 
ev
ent
. But 
in
 sp
ite 
of 
all
 this 
fin
e 
tal
k
ing, 
my dear
 
Lizz
y, 
you
 may 
res
t 
perfec
tly 
ass
ur
ed that 
your 
un
cl
e 
would 
never
 have 
y
i
eld
ed, 
if
 we 
had 
not 
giv
en
 him
 c
re
d

E
very

ha

to be

done 
much
. She 
was 
as
ham

 think
 how
 much

he had 
giv

inter

which
 as

no 
ex

reason

that he 
should 
feel

 he 
had 
li

al

, and 
he had 
the

; and 
though

would 
not

she 
could

t 
his

where 
her 
p

must be 
mat

ful

ex

to

they were

every

Oh,

For
 herself

pr

that 
in

hon

 he 
had been

read 
over

 a

again

much
 more

sm

looked

said 
many

He

Mr. Benn

Mrs. Bennet 
very

This

Elizabeth

an

 d

CHAPTER 
L

V
. As

 as 
they were

Elizabeth
 w

out 
to

Mr. Darc

be

. “
Wh

if he 
came 
only 
to be 
sil

gr

ind

,” said 
sh

did 
he 
come 
at all
?” 
S
he 
could 
se
t
tle 
it 
in 
no
 w

 that 
gave 
her 
pleas

. “
He 
could 
be 
still
 am

still 
pleas

my 
un

a

when
 he 
was

I

T

I w
ill

no

about 
him

H
er 
res

ut

 was 
for
 a
 shor
t 
time 
inv
ol
unt

ily 
k

by the 
ap

 her
 sister
, wh

jo

with a 
ch

ful 
look 
which
 sh
ow

better
 s
atis
fi

 their 
vis

than 
Elizabeth
. “
Now
,” said 
sh
e, “
that 
this 
first 
me
et
ing 
is 
over

I 
feel
 
perfec

I sh

never

Y
es, 
very 
ind

inde

,” said 
Elizabeth
, 
laugh
ing
ly
. “
Oh, 
Jan

take

.” “
My 
dear
 
Lizz
y, 
you
 can
not 
think

so
 w

I
 think 
you are 
in 
very 
great 
d
ang
er of 
mak

 as 
much 
in 
love 
with 
you
 as

Th
ey 
did not 
se

gentle
men
 a
g

till 
T
u
es
day
; and 
Mrs. Benn
et, 
in the 
mean
wh
il
e, 
was 
giv

way 
to 
all the 
happ

s
ch

which the 
good

comm

of 
Bingle

in

alf
 
an

had 
rev

O
n 
T
u
es
day
 there 
was 
a 
large 
part
y 
ass
em
bl

at 
Longbour

; and the 
two 
who
 were 
most 
anx

to the

 their 
p
un

as

were 
in 
very 
good 
tim

Wh
en
 they 
rep
air

to the 
d
in
ing-
room
, 
Elizabeth 
ea
ger
ly 
wat
ched 
to see 
wh
e
ther 
Bingle
y 
would 
take 
the 
place 
which
, in 
all
 their 
form
er 
part
ies, 
had 
bel
ong

 him, 
by 
her
 sister
. H
er 
pr

mother
, 
oc
c

id

for
bor

to 
inv

him 
to s

by 
herself
. 
O
n 
enter

room
, he 
seem

 h

at
e
; but 
Jane 
happ
en

look 
round
, and 
happ
en

to s
mil

: 
it was 
dec
id

plac

by 
her
. Elizabeth
, 
with a 
tri
um
ph
ant 
s

ation, 
look

wards 
his 
friend
. He 
bor
e 
it 
with 
no
ble 
ind

; and 
she 
would have 
im
ag
in

Bingle
y 
had 
receiv

s

to be 
happ

had 
she 
not 
seen
 his

turn

wards 
Mr. Darc
y, 
with 
an 
express
ion
 of
 h
alf
-
laugh
ing 
al
arm
. His 
be
ha
vi
our
 to
 her
 s
ister 
was 
such
 d
ur
ing 
d
inn
er
time 
as 
sh

ed 
an
 ad
mir

 of
 her
, 
which
, 
though
 more 
gu

than 
form
er

per
su
ad
ed 
Elizabeth
, 
that
, 
if 
left 
whol
ly 
to
 himself
, 
Jan
e’s 
happ
in
ess
, and 
his 
own
, 
would be 
sp

ed
ily 
sec
ure
d
. Th
ough
 she 
dar

not 
d
ep
end 
upon the 
con
sequ
ence, 
she 
yet 
receiv
ed 
pleas
ure 
from 
observ
ing his 
be
ha
vi
our
. It 
gave 
her 
all the 
an
im
ation
 that 
her
 sp
ir
its 
could 
bo
ast
; 
for
 she 
was 
in 
no 
ch
eer
ful
 h
um
our
. 
Mr. Darcy 
was 
almost 
as 
far 
from
 her
 as 
the 
table 
could 
d
iv
ide 
them
. He 
was 
on 
one 
side 
of her 
mother
. She 
knew
 h
ow 
little 
such
 a s
it
u
ation
 would 
give 
pleas
ure 
to 
eith
er, 
or
 m
ake 
eith
er
 a
pp
ear
 to
 ad
v
ant
age
. She 
was not 
near
 
enough
 to
 hear
 
any 
of
 their
 dis
cour
se
; but 
she 
could 
see 
how
 s
eld
om
 they 
spo
ke 
to 
each 
other
, and 
how 
form
al 
and 
c
old 
was 
their
 man
n
er 
when
ever
 they 
did
. H
er 
mother
’s 
un
gr
ac
ious
ness 
made 
the s
ens
e of 
what 
they 
ow
ed him
 more 
pain
ful
 to 
Elizabeth
’s 
mind
; and 
she 
w
oul
d, 
at 
tim

have 
giv
en 
anything 
to be 
p
riv
il
eg

tell
 him
, that 
his 
kind
ness 
was 
ne
ith
er 
un
know
n 
n
or 
un
felt 
by the 
whole 
of the 
famil

. She 
was 
in
 hop

that the 
even

would 
af

d 
some 
op
port
un

br

 to
gether
;
 that 
the 
whole 
of the 
vis

would 
not 
p
as
s 
away 
without 
en
a
bl

 to 
ent

in
to s

thing 
more 
of 
con

than
 the 
m

cer

. A

and 
un

the 
peri

which 
pass
ed in the 
draw
ing-
room
 
before 
the 
gentle

 c

was 
w
ear
is
ome 
and 
d
ull
 to
 a 
de
gre

that 
almost 
made 
her 
un
civil
. She 
looked 
for
ward 
to
 their 
ent

ance 
as the 
poin
t 
on 
which 
all
 her 
ch
ance 
of 
pleas

for the

must 
d
ep

. “
I
f

does 
not 
come 
to

then
,” said 
sh
e, “
I sh
all 
give 
him 
up 
for 
ever
.” 
The 
gentle
men
 c
am

she 
thought 
he 
looked 
as 
if he 
would have 
answer

 hop

bu

al

!
 the 
lad

had 
cr

the 
ta

where 
Miss 
Benn

was

in

that 
there 
was not 
a s

which
 would 
ad

of a

on the 
gentle

’s 
ap

one of the 
girl
s 
mov

cl

to her

said
, 
in a 
wh

per

The

Darc
y 
had 
wal

away 
to 
another 
par

. She 
follow

 with
 her 
ey

every

to 
whom
 he 
spo

then
 was 
en

against

for

“
A

There 
is 
no

so

S
he was 
a little 
rev

however, 
by 
his 
br

ing 
back
 his 
c
off

-
c

she 
se

S
he 
could 
th

of 
nothing 
more 
to s

; but 
if he 
wish
ed to 
con

with
 her

might 
have 
better

for
 some

at

wh

all

were

at

she had 
nothing

that

to make

Mrs. Bennet 
had 
des

N

un

Well

“

CHAPTER 
L
V
. A
 
few
 d

s 
after
 this 
vis

Mr. Bingle
y 
called 
again
, and 
al

. His 
fri

had 
left 
him
 that 
morn

for 
L

, but 
was 
to 
return

in 
ten

was 
in

Mrs. Bennet 
inv

 to

bu

with
 many 
express

concern
, he 
conf

where
. “
N

sh
e, “
I
 hop

He 
should 
be 
particular
ly 
happ

at 
any 
time, 
et
c

, 
et
c

; and 
if
 she 
would 
give 
him 
leav

would 
take 
an 
ear

op
port
un

wa

on
 them
. “
C

Y
es, 
he had 
no 
engag

at 
all 
for 
to

mor
row
; and 
her 
inv

 was 
ac

with 
al
ac

. He

in s

very 
good

with

W
e 
will be 
down
 as 
soon
 as 
we 
can

Jan
e; 
“
but 
I d
are

K

where

my dear

But 
when
 her 
mo

was 
g
one, 
Jane 
would 
not be 
prev
ail
ed 
on 
to 
go 
down
 with
out 
one 
of
 her
 sister
s
. The 
same 
anx

to 
get 
them 
by
 them
selv

was 
vis

again 
in the 
even

. A
f

Mr. Benn
et 
ret

was 
his

M
ary 
went 
up

w

ob

Elizabeth

Cather
ine 
for
 a
 con
sider
able 
time, 
without 
mak

any 
im

on
 them
. Elizabeth
 would 
not 
ob
ser

her
; and 
when 
at last 
K
it
ty 
did
, she 
very 
in
no
c

said
, “
What

What

No

ch

no

S
he 
then
 s

still

min
ut

long

; but 
un
able 
to

got 
up

K

C

my 
lov

,” 
too
k
 her 
out 
of the

. 
Jane 
inst

gave 
a 
look 
at 
Elizabeth 
which
 s
po

her 
dist

at 
such

her 
ent

at

 that 
she 
would 
not

. In
 a 
few
 m
in
ut

Mrs. Bennet 
half
 
open
ed the 
do
or 
and 
called 
out
,- “
Lizz

my dear
, I
 w

to sp

you
.” 
Elizabeth
 was 
for
c

go
. “
W

may 
as 
well 
leave 
them 
by
 them
selv

her 
mother
 as 
soon
 as 
she was 
in the

K

Elizabeth

no

, but 
remain

K

Mrs. Benn
et
’s 
s

for
 this

were

he

of the

heard 
all

before

next

f

 this

, 
Jane 
said 
no

Not

Elizabeth

un

Mr. Darcy

however
, she 
felt

all
 this 
must 
have

with

was 
p

he 
and 
Mr. Benn
et 
sp

the 
morn
ing to

, as 
had been
 a
gre

on
. The 
lat

was 
much
 more 
ag

ea

than
 his 
comp

expec

. There 
was 
nothing 
of 
pres

or 
f

in 
Bingle

 that 
could 
pro
vo

his 
rid

or
 dis

 in

he was 
more 
comm

less 
ec

than
 the 
other
 had 
ever

return

in the 
even

Mrs. Benn
et
’s 
inv

 was 
again 
at 
wor

to 
get 
every
body 
away 
from
 him
 and 
her 
daughter
. Elizabeth
, who
 had 
a 
let

to 
wr

went 
into the 
break
f
ast-
room
 for
 that 
pur

soon
 af

t

for
 as 
the 
other

all 
going 
to s

down
 to

she 
could not 
be

on
 her 
return

draw

, when
 her 
let

was 
fin

she 
saw
, 
to her 
in
fin

sur
pris

there was 
reason 
to 
fear
 that 
her 
mother
 had 
been 
too 
ing
en

for
 her
. 
O
n 
open

door
, she

and 
Bingle

would have

aw

her

Not

was 
utter

Elizabeth
 was 
on the

again
, when 
Bingle

Jane 
could 
have 
no

Elizabeth
, wh

 she 
add

by

Oh

Elizabeth

which
 w

could

E
very

of 
kind

was 
a 
fre

of

to 
Jan

she 
would 
not

or

remain

for the

 she 
cri

. “
I

Oh,

S

In

she was

Bingle

Wickham

Jane

that

she 
car

er 
young

soon 
began 
to make

K

from

when
 some 
b

ne

 could 
not be

 d
et
est

had 
giv

an 
inv

which he 
thought 
him
self 
ob

 had 
now 
but 
little 
time 
for
 con
vers

 with
 her
 sister
; 
for 
while 
he was 
present 
Jane 
had 
no
 att

 to 
bes

on 
any
one 
el

: 
but 
she 
found 
herself
 con
sider
ably 
us

ful
 to 
both
 of
 them
, in
 those 
h
our

 se
par

 that 
must 
sometimes 
oc

 the 
ab

of

he 
always 
at

Elizabeth

when 
Bingle

Jane 
con

It 
must 
have been
 his

were 
certain

no

I can
not

he

Th

is the 
most 
un

Elizabeth
, “
that 
I

It

W

that 
when

her

f

had 
before

in

of

was not

hop

that 
Darc

might

, 
by 
his

was 
to

-
 “
My

Lizz

“
I w

you

f 
you 
love 
Mr. Darcy 
half
 so
 w

 as 
I d

 my

Wickham
, 
you
 must 
be 
very 
happ

. It 
is a 
great 
com

t 
to have 
you
 so 
ri

when 
you have 
nothing 
el

to 
do
, I
 hop
e 
you w
ill
 think 
of

. I
 am
 s

Wickham
 would 
like a 
place 
at 
cour
t 
very 
much
; and 
I d
o not 
think
 we 
sh
all
 have 
quite 
m
one
y 
enough
 to 
live 
upon
 with
out 
some 
help
. A
n
y 
place 
would 
do 
of
 about 
three 
or 
f
our
 h
un
dr

a 
year
; 
bu
t, 
however, 
do 
not 
sp

to 
Mr. Darcy 
about 
it, 
if 
you
 had 
rather 
not
. “
Y

et
c

it 
happ

Elizabeth
 had 
much 
rather 
no

she 
end
eav
our

 her 
answ

to 
put 
an

however
, as 
it was

she 
fre

had 
always

when

at

ter

I

certain

at

my

would 
not be 
very

; but 
consider

I was 
us

, 
could 
st

sp

a

all
 that
, I
 m
ade 
no

that 
from 
all 
I had 
heard 
I should 
be 
off

at le

what
ever
 that 
might 
ev

ally 
am
oun

to
. And 
though
 the 
2
7
5
th 
l

was
what 
they 
call
 a 
rather 
long 
l
ay, 
yet 
it was 
better
 than 
no
thing
; 
and
if
 we 
had 
a 
l

voy

might 
pre
tt
y 
near

p

for the

I
would 
w

not

my
 three

for 
which 
I
 would 
not 
have

It 
might 
be

that 
this 
was 
a

to

and 
so 
it 
was
, 
a very 
po

inde

I am 
one 
of th

that 
never 
take

U
p

I

would be 
about

My

only 
an

is, 
what

the s

A
l

you
know 
what

Now
, 
how
ever 
pre

may 
at

seem
 to

of

these 
are 
no

against

because

T

from the

you

Now
, 
from

it

 that

no

’

you

how

did 
you

You

you

you

M

in

I

which 
each

therefor

must

on
 this

another

while 
all 
between
 must 
be 
prof

and
no

. M
an

on

from
 a s

with

is 
a

always 
to be

and
to be

I

the

W

this

I

only 
bre

about 
one

or 
S

of his

It 
has 
been
 said 
that the

only

through
 his

-
ho

if

could 
tru

his

then 
I 
op

we 
should 
be

with the

wh

his

in

; 
for the 
only
 th

him
 that 
at
all 
answ

to his 
no

is 
that 
id

-
ho

; and 
be
ing
 so
c
lo

with 
two 
el

it 
could not 
be 
expec

to have 
the 
pow

of s

ow

my
ster

of the 
sp

—
wh

ther 
it 
be 
water
or 
wh

ther 
it 
be

—
no
 ab
sol
ut

certain
ty 
can
 as 
yet 
be 
ar
riv

at
on
 this

. S
ure 
it 
is, 
never
th
el

that the 
Sperm 
Whale 
has 
no
pro

what 
does 
he 
w

of them
? 
N

r
os
es, 
no

let

no 
C

F

as

E

is

 of

ex

 of

therefor
e the

has 
no

un

ins

by 
say

that 
when
 he 
so
 str

r

h
et
al
k

through

then
 again
, 
what 
has 
the 
whale 
to s
ay
?
S
eld
om
 have 
I 
know
n 
any 
prof

be

had 
anything

to
 this

un

for

to s

something 
by

Oh

 happ

 that 
the

such 
an 
exc

Now
, the 
sp

can
al 
of the 
Sperm 
Whal

chief
ly 
int
ended 
as 
it 
is
for the 
con

of

for

hor

just 
ben

a

 this 
cur

can

is 
very

p

the

return

wh

this 
g

p

is 
also
 a w

-
p
ip

in 
other 
word
s, 
wh
ether
 the 
sp

to
f
 the

is the 
m

certain
 that 
the

it

this 
is

when

the

there 
he

id

if 
you

time

you w

 that

P

“

And 
by

this

But 
wh

should 
the

 have 
the 
head
, and the 
Qu

? 
A
 
reason

, 
ye 
l

!
In

Now
 this

wr

this

is
not

it is

is the

A
